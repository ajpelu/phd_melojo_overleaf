\paragraph{Abstract} \mbox{} \\
\Qp forests in Sierra Nevada have suffered intense anthropic pressures causing modifications in their structure and composition. Historically they were exploited in coppice for charcoal, firewood, or they were thinned and even burned to create grazing areas. However, the abandonment of traditional uses and exploitation since the middle of the last century has led to a decrease in anthropic pressure on these ecosystems. Paradoxically, some of these oak woodlands present a state of advanced degradation (stagnation of growth; scarce regeneration; etc), with stands with high densities and high biomass accumulation, increasing the fire risk. Taking into account this situation, and considering the vulnerability of this species to global change, it is necessary to search alternatives to the traditional uses of coppice management, particularly for those stands located in their rear edge (such us the oak woodlands of Sierra Nevada), due to their relevance for the species conservation. 
In this work we present a comprehensive review of the main ecosystem services provided by \Qpy focusing on oak woodlands located in Sierra Nevada mountain region.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:es:intro}

Forest ecosystems provide a wide range of ecosystem services to society. In addition to the production of tangible forest products, such as timber, fuelwood, cork, mushrooms, medicinal and aromatic plants, etc., they also provide less tangible ones, such as regulation of water and nutrient cycles, carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation, protection and conservation of biodiversity, as well as provision of cultural services related to experience and recreation in nature \autocite{Acharyaetal2019GlobalTrend,Baetenetal2019IdentifyingTree,deGrootetal2002TypologyClassification,FelipeLuciaetal2018MultipleForest,Gamfeldtetal2013HigherLevels,Iversonetal2018EcosystemServices,Stengeretal2009ValuingEnvironmental}. 

Mediterranean forests are subject to significant and simultaneous pressures \autocites{FAOPlanBleu2018StateMediterranean, DoblasMirandaetal2017ReviewCombination}, and climate change is expected to strongly affect to Mediterranean Region \autocite{GiorgiLionello2008ClimateChange, Penuelasetal2017ImpactsGlobal,Crameretal2018ClimateChange,Crameretal2020ClimateEnvironmental}, which is considered a hotspot for climate change \autocite{Giorgi2006ClimateChange}. The impacts of global change on Mediterranean forest ecosystems are altering the supply of ecosystem services \autocite{Lindneretal2010ClimateChange,Lindneretal2014ClimateChange,NoceSantini2018MediterraneanForest,Penuelasetal2017ImpactsGlobal,SerradaHierroetal2011ImpactosVulnerabilidad} particularly in mountainous regions, which have show a high vulnerability to climate change \autocite{Schroteretal2005EcosystemService}. Notwithstanding, Mediterranean forests provide a multiple variety of services \autocite{NoceSantini2018MediterraneanForest}, and represent a great asset and opportunities for the future of the Mediterranean basin \autocite{Gauquelinetal2018MediterraneanForests, NoceSantini2018MediterraneanForest}. Hence, the importance of Mediterranean forests derives both from their current value in terms of area and goods and services, and from the role they are likely to play in the future \autocites{FAOPlanBleu2018StateMediterranean}.

Among the Mediterranean type forests, the oak woodlands are key ecosystems providing variety of ecosystem services \autocite{Maranonetal2020IberianOaks}. They provide regulating services such as climate regulation by their capacity to sequester carbon and therefore to mitigate the effects of climatic change; and contribute to regulation of the air, soil and water quality \autocite{Maranonetal2012EstadoTendencia}. Oak woodlands also provide several raw materials (provisioning services): cork, firewood, acorns \autocite{Bugalhoetal2011MediterraneanCork}. These forests also provide cultural ecosystems, such as recreational, aesthetic and spiritual \autocite{Lofetal2016ManagementOak}. In order to conserve the valuable goods and services provided for the benefit of populations and the environment, it is important to be aware of their potential of these forest, while respecting the natural load these ecosystems can sustainably support. 

\subsection{The case of \Qpy woodlands in the Western Mediterranean Region}\label{sec:es:intro-qp}
\Qpw (Pyrenean oak, \emph{melojo}) is a deciduous Mediterranean tree species widely distributed throughout southwestern France and the Iberian Peninsula reaching their southern limit in mountain areas of northern Morocco \autocites{Franco1990Quercus}. In the Iberian Peninsula, their forests occupy siliceous soils under meso-supramediterranean and mesotemperate areas and subhumid, humid, and hyperhumid ombroclimate \autocites{delaSernaetal2016MarcescentQuercus,Gavilanetal2018SclerophyllousDeciduous}. The rear-edge populations of this species are restricted to high-mountain areas where these populations persist as isolated nuclei with ecological conditions very different from those of the main distribution area \autocites{PerezLuqueetal2021EcologicalDiversity}.

\Qp woodlands, like other forest ecosystems in Mediterranean area, have been subject to intense anthropogenic pressures over time \autocite{GarciaJimenez20099230Robledales}, resulting in a reduction of their distribution area and a modification of their floristic \autocites{Serradaetal1992CoppiceSystem,Gavilanetal2000EffectsDisturbance,PerezLuqueetal2021EcologicalDiversity} and structural patterns \autocites{Calvoetal1999PostfireSuccession,Tarregaetal2006ForestStructure}. Historically, \Qp woodlands have been exploited in coppices for firewood, charcoal, tannins, casca (\emph{i.e.} parts of the bark used to extract tannins), and other uses \autocites{RuizdelaTorre2006FloraMayor,SanchezPalomaresetal2008EstacionesEcologicas}. For instance, after the Spanish Civil war, some oak woodlands were massively cut down to use the firewood as fuel for automobiles (\emph{e.g.} Dehesa de San Jerónimo, Sierra Nevada)\autocite{Prieto1975BosquesSierra}. Forest management for \Qp coppices consisted of clear-cutting in rotation periods of 12-20 years, causing the profusion of shoots from the stool highly appreciated by livestock \autocite{Bravoetal2008SelviculturaMontes}. Thinning has also been carried out to create pastures with low densities of mature trees that provide acorns, firewood and large areas for grazing; and sometimes even burned to create grazing areas \autocites{HerreraCalvo2016UsoPastoral,Alvarezetal2009CambiosEstructura,ValbuenaCarabanaGil2017CentenaryCoppicing}. In fact, overgrazing in these formations have caused strong soil erosion loss, which was noticed by forest managers since the end of the 19th century \autocites{Laguna1872ComisionFlora}. All these anthropogenic processes have transformed the oak woodlands in a deep way that it is difficult to find stands that can be considered natural forests \autocites{RuizdelaTorre2006FloraMayor}. In some areas, the strong anthropic pressure provoked the loss of the forest cover, which resulted in severe soil erosion problems. For instance, in southern slopes of Sierra Nevada mountains, oak woodland forests were completely removed at the at the beginning of the 20th century, causing serious soil erosion problems, which led it to be considered the most torrential watershed in Spain \autocites{RomeroZurbano1909DivisionHidrologicoforestal}. 
  
However, the abandonment of traditional uses since the middle of the last century \autocites{MacDonaldetal2000AgriculturalAbandonment}, has caused a decrease in anthropogenic pressure on Mediterranean forest ecosystems \autocites{ValbuenaCarabanaetal2010HistoricalRecent}, being particularly important for mountain areas \autocites{JimenezOlivenciaetal2015MedioSiglo,JimenezOlivenciaetal2015EvolucionUsos,Piasetal2014ColonizationAbandoned}. Paradoxically, and considering this decrease in anthropogenic pressure, many of the \Qp oak stands present a state of advanced degradation, showing growth stagnation, lack of fruiting, and also sings of branch dieback  \autocites{Canellasetal2004GrowthResponse, Bravoetal2008SelviculturaMontes, ValbuenaCarabanaGil2014EfectosGestion, PiqueVericat2015EvolutionPerspectives, Piqueetal2018Spain}. Many stands also have high tree density that would increase the vulnerability of these stands \autocite{McDowelletal2020PervasiveShifts}, and together with the accumulation of biomass and high horizontal continuity, would increase the risk of fire \autocites{Bravoetal2008SelviculturaMontes,GarciaJimenez20099230Robledales}. In addition, these problems may be aggravated in the context of current climate change (increase in temperatures and higher incidence of extreme events such as droughts) \autocites{IPCC2013ClimateChange,Spinonietal2018WillDrought}, particularly considering the high vulnerability of this species to climate change \autocites{Benitoetal2011SimulatingPotential,GarciaValdesetal2013ChasingMoving,SanchezdeDiosetal2009PresentFuture,GeaIzquierdoetal2013GrowthProjections}. 

In view of this situation, the need to find for alternative uses for \Qp woodlands has been pointed out \autocites{MesonMontoya1985VegetacionForestal,SanMigueletal2012BosquesMatorrales}, and some management alternatives have been proposed \autocite[\emph{e.g.} sylvopastoral uses,][]{HerreraCalvo2016UsoPastoral}. In this sense, the identification of ecosystem services becomes a crucial tool to develop forest management strategies for these stands in a global change context \autocites{Piqueetal2018Spain}. 

Very little has been written about the ecosystem services provided by oak forests \autocites{Maranonetal2012OakTrees,Maranonetal2012EstadoTendencia,MorenoLlorcaetal2012MontanaMediterranea}. Some works have carried out a general valuation of the ecosystem services provided by the different \emph{Quercus} woodlands at regional and national scales \autocite{SanMigueletal2012BosquesMatorrales,Maranonetal2012EstadoTendencia,Sousaetal2020EcosystemServices}, and some works provided temporal trend analysis of ecosystem services from an economic perspective \autocites{Caparrosetal2013EconomicsEcosystem}. However, to our knowledge, to date there is no comprehensive review of the ecosystem services provided by oak woodlands dominted by \Qp. 

The aim of this work is to carry out a review of the main ecosystem services provided by \Qp woodlands. We conduct a literature review to know the state of the art of the ecosystem services provided by these formations. Using the Sierra Nevada oak populations as study-case we explore more in depth the ecosystem services provided by this woodlands. For this purpose we combine expert knowledge and data coming from ecological monitoring programs and several research projects to quantify as far as possible the ecosystem services provided by this formation in Sierra Nevada. Finally, we explore the spatial patterns of the ecosystems services provided for the oak population cluster's identified in Sierra Nevada \autocite[see][]{PerezLuqueetal2021EcologicalDiversity}.  

\section{Material and methods}\label{sec:es:mat}

To characterize the scientific literature that evaluate the ecosystem services (ES) of the Pyrenean oak woodlands, we performed a preliminary systematic search in the ISI Web of Knowledge. We compiled references published in indexed journals included in the Journal of Citation Reports (JCR), in English language, since 1970 to 2020, that evaluated indicators of ecosystem services in \Qp woodlands. First, we conducted a search for papers on the study species with the term \emph{"Quercus pyrenaica"} in the title, keywords or abstract, which produced 393 results. We applied a second criterion, to extract papers that analyzed possible services, including a broad list of terms (also in the title, keywords or abstract) related to ES (\tabref{tab:es:wos}). The combination of both produced 188 results. After reviewing their abstracts, we selected 60 papers that met the premise of evaluating ES in Pyrenean oak woodlands (\tabref{tab:es-review}). We omitted papers focused exclusively on descriptive aspects of these ecosystems (\emph{e.g.} floristic composition or ecosystem structure), their biodiversity (\emph{e.g.} species richness) or their functioning, which were not directly related to ecosystem service indicators.

For the classification and definition of ecosystem services, we used the CICES V5.1 (Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services) approach \autocites{HainesYoungPotschin2018CommonInternational}. This is an international effort to classify ecosystem services, which also has common points with other approaches such as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment \autocite{MEA2005EcosystemsHuman}, and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) initiative \autocite{TEEB2010EconomicsEcosystems}. We have considered three categories of ecosystem services: provisioning, regulating and cultural. For each of these categories, different indicators related to the provision of specific ecosystem services were defined (\tabref{tab:es:data}).

For each of the ecosystem services reviewed, we performed a quantification for the Sierra Nevada oak woodland populations, as long as data were available (\tabref{tab:es:data}). The values for the quantification were obtained both from the literature review and from several research datasets in combination with the expert criterion. For those ecosystems services with data availability, we performed a quantification for each of the oak population clusters identified in Sierra Nevada \autocite[N: Northern, NW: Northwestern, and S: Southern; see][]{PerezLuqueetal2021EcologicalDiversity}. 

\section{Ecosystem services}\label{sec:es:results}

Of the 60 papers collected in the literature review (see \tabref{tab:es:wos}), provisioning services were the most frequently evaluated. Among them, the studies focused on investigating the effect of melojo wood in the wine production process stand out, since barrels are frequently built with the wood of this species. In addition, there are papers evaluating mushroom production or the effect of this species on livestock production. In addition there were studies evaluating the production of wood or biomass for energy. As for regulation services, several studies evaluate the role of \Qp forests in soil quality and fertility (\emph{e.g.} nutritional aspects), or their capacity for carbon sequestration and storage. Finally, it should be noted that no studies have been found, applying the aforementioned search criteria, that evaluate cultural services in the ecosystems under study.

\section{Regulating services}\label{sec:es:regulation}
\subsection{Soil climate regulation}\label{sec:es:regulation-soil}
Soil temperature is one of the main factors affecting seed germination, plant growth and development, being as important as air temperature, since it can limit root formation \autocites{AlvarezUriaKorner2007LowTemperature}. The marcescent feature of \Qp allows the accumulation of leaf litter layer on the ground during a part of the year. This accumulation can have positive effects on seedling establishment because it acts as a thermal insulator \autocites{Loydietal2014DistributionEffects}, helping to alleviate the damage effects of freezing on seeds \autocites{Loydietal2014DistributionEffects,CavenderBaresetal2005SummerWinter,EstesoMartinezGilPelegrin2004FrostResistance,Lofetal2019TammReview}. This buffer effect can also be important once germination starts, since negative temperatures can suspend the process and damage the radicle and epicotyl \autocites{AizenWoodcock1996EffectsAcorn}. However, negative effects on seed germination and establishment could prevail (\emph{e.g.}, pathogen proliferation; allelopathic effects) when litter accumulation exceeds a certain threshold \autocites{Loydietal2014DistributionEffects,XiongNilsson1999EffectsPlant}.

It has also been noticed the importance of the forest cover on the regulation of extremes temperatures registered during the summer period \autocites{DeFrenneetal2021ForestMicroclimates}. It is particularly important for melojo oaks woodland located at the warm rear-edge of their distribution. For instance, using microclimatic data from a sensor network deployed in an oak woodland located at southern slopes of Sierra Nevada, \citet{Zamoraetal2021UniendoMacro} found strong variations of the air and soil temperatures registered inside the forest compared with the registered on forest's open areas (\figref{fig:es:temp}). The soil temperatures varied up to 15ºC between microhabitats on a day of maximum temperatures during the summer period, which shows the role of the oak tree vegetation on the regulation of the thermal environment \autocites{Niinemets2010ResponsesForest}. The oak forest cover provides a cooler environment, reducing potential evapotranspiration and alleviating the water stress to which these formations are subjected in summer \autocites{Zamoraetal2021UniendoMacro}.

For each variable, the values recorded in the different habitats are compared: forest clearings (open) and forest areas (forest). Source: \autocite{Zamoraetal2021UniendoMacro}}\label{fig:es:temp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Carbon sequestration}\label{sec:es:regulation-carbon}
Carbon sequestration is one of the most relevant ecosystem services provided by Mediterranean forests \autocites{Gauquelinetal2018MediterraneanForests,NoceSantini2018MediterraneanForest}. The carbon stock can be assumed as an indicator of the capacity of ecosystems to contribute to climate regulation due to their potential to influence the concentration of atmospheric CO$_2$ \autocites{Lauterbach2007AssessmentExisting,Luyssaertetal2008OldgrowthForests}. Mediterranean forests represent a carbon sink that is expected to increase in the coming decades \autocites{Canellasetal2017CarbonSequestration,PasalodosTatoetal2017EvaluationTree}.
Combining information from LIDAR (\emph{Light Detection And Ranging}) remote sensing with information from different forest inventories, the forest biomass in the oak forests of the Sierra Nevada were estimated, and a cartography of the biomass and carbon sequestration potential of these ecosystems were generated \autocites{PerezLuqueetal2021CarbonSequestration} (see also chapter \ref{sec:carbon}). The estimated total biomass (aboveground- and belowground-biomass) in the \Qp forests of the Sierra Nevada amounts to 9.94 Tg (1 Tg = 10$^12$ g), which represents a potential CO$_2$ sequestration of 17.33 Tg (1 Tg = 10$^12$ g).

Soil organic carbon (\emph{SOC}) is the main component of soil organic matter, being of vital importance for many soil processes. For example, SOC content correlates positively with soil fertility, playing a key role determining the physical, chemical and biological qualities of a soil \autocites{Victoriaetal2012BenefitsSoil}. There are different ecosystem services in which SOC is involved, among which regulation and provisioning services stand out \autocites{Francavigliaetal2018OrganicCarbon}. A first step to account its importance would be to estimate the soil organic carbon content of oak woodlands. Although, there are some studies that reported the amount of soil organic carbon in specific locations of the Sierra Nevada \autocites{CoboDiazetal2017TaxonomicFunctional,Lasaetal2019BacteriaEndosphere}, they prove insufficient to provide an approximated estimate the total SOC content this oak woodlands. Nevertheless, others information sources could be used to estimate the SOC content at a ecosystem level, allowing also a comparison between different locations. For instance, the SoilGrid database (https://soilgrids.org/) provides several digital maps of different soil variables at a spatial resolution of 250 m \autocites{Hengletal2017SoilGrids250mGlobal}, built from a global database of soil profiles (\emph{WoSIS}, World Soil Information Service) \autocites{Batjesetal2017WoSISProviding,Batjesetal2020StandardisedSoil}. We used the mean SOC at a 0-30 cm depth to estimate the soil carbon estimate of Sierra Nevada, and then we extracted the values for oak woodlands. Sierra Nevada soils have an average SOC content of 51.8 Mg ha$^-1$ (20-80 Mg ha$^-1$) (\figref{fig:es:soc}), while the oak forests have a average SOC value of 53.5 Mg ha$^-1$ (45-67 Mg ha$^-1$), with southern oaks populations showing significantly higher values. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/es/es-soc.pdf}\caption{Distribution of the Soil organic carbon in Sierra Nevada. Oak populations in white. Drawn with data from SoilGrid database}\label{fig:es:soc}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Erosion control}\label{sec:es:regulation-erosion}
Canopy forest has a key role in the reduction of the erosive rainfall impact on soil, so it provides an important regulating service \autocites{Zhongmingetal2010StratifiedVegetation,GarciaRuizetal2011MediterraneanWater}. The root system of \Qp consists of two well-differentiated types \autocites{Allue1995OrdenacionMasas}: \emph{(i)} the main root, characteristic of the genus, which allows for powerful anchoring to the soil; and \emph{(ii)} a layer of roots close to the soil surface and parallel to it, which could emit large number of shoots that form a dense network. Those root systems that help to maintain soil integrity by preserving landslides \autocites{MesonMontoya1985VegetacionForestal,Salomonetal2017GeneralFailure} (\figref{fig:es:roots}). In addition, the extraordinary regrowth capacity of \Qp, both of stump and roots, gives it functional advantages over other species, such as its response to disturbances (\emph{e.g.}, fires), particularly on sloping areas \autocites{RuizdelaTorre2006FloraMayor,ValbuenaCarabanaGil2017CentenaryCoppicing}. The profusion of resprouts allows it to effectively maintain the soil in mountainous areas, reducing the impact of erosive processes and loss of soil \autocites{MesonGarcia1984BasesEcologicas}, an important ecosystem service of regulation. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/es/es-roots.jpg}\caption{Structure of the complex root system of several specimens of \Qp. Picture from R. Salomón.}\label{fig:es:roots}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Climatic regulation}\label{sec:es:regulation-climatic}
Spectral vegetation indices, \emph{e.g.} EVI and NDVI are frequently used to derive indicators of ecosystem functioning, such as the total annual carbon absorbed by vegetation, or the seasonality and phenology of carbon gain dynamics \autocites{Xiaoetal2019RemoteSensing,
AlcarazSeguraetal2009BaselineCharacterization,AlcarazSeguraetal2009UseDescriptors,Cazorlaetal2020RemoteSensingbased}. Some works have analyzed the evolution of the productivity of different ecosystems in Sierra Nevada using vegetation indices from MODIS satellite data \autocites{Dionisioetal2012SatelliteBasedMonitoring,Alcaraz2016obsnev_ndvi,PerezLuque2015onto,Cazorlaetal2020RemoteSensingbased}. The results of these works have revealed that oak forests, despite their high seasonality, are the most productive ecosystems in Sierra Nevada for the period analyzed (2000-2017), highlighting their importance in carbon gain and therefore as carbon sinks. Likewise, the time series analysis showed a positive trend in productivity (EVI) for most Sierra Nevada oak forests, possibly related to the increase in temperature \autocite{PerezLuque2015onto}. 

\section{Supporting and provisioning services}\label{sec:es:provision}
\subsection{Biodiversity}\label{sec:es:provision-biodiversity}

\Qp forests in Sierra Nevada have high values of phytosociological uniqueness \autocites{Loriteetal2008PhytosociologicalReview}, wich could be explained because they act as habitat providers for other relict species. In fact, the role of refugee of Sierra Nevada for this formation \autocites{Breweretal2002SpreadDeciduous,Olaldeetal2002WhiteOaks,RodriguezSanchezetal2010TreeRange}, translates into a great diversity of plant species, being the forest formation with the greatest richness in Sierra Nevada, although it only represents 7\% of the forest area \autocites{PerezLuqueetal2014SinfonevadaDataset}. A key role of \Qp woodlands in Sierra Nevada is that they provides optimal conditions for the presence of several plant species cataloged under different threatened categories \autocites{Lorite2016UpdatedChecklist,Losaetal1986PaisajeVegetal,MelendoValle2000EstudioComparativo}. Some species are considered \emph{critically endangered} (CR), such as the hybrid mustard (\emph{Sorbus hybrida} L.); \emph{endangered} (EN), such as the goat willow (\emph{Salix caprea} L.); \emph{vulnerable} (VU), such as the holly (\emph{Ilex aquifolium} L.) and the yew (\emph{Taxus baccata} L.); and others with a lower level of threat (\emph{e.g.} \emph{near threat}, NT) such as the rowan (\emph{Sorbus aria} (L.) Crantz), or the maple (\emph{Acer opalus} subsp. \emph{granatense} (Boiss.) Font Quer \& Rothm.). Many of these species are considered relict species that find favorable microclimatic conditions in the Pyrenean oak of Sierra Nevada, which make these ecosystems a refuge for those species \autocites{Blancaetal1998ThreatenedVascular,Lorite2016UpdatedChecklist,Losaetal1986PaisajeVegetal}. 

Birds community of \Qp forests of Sierra Nevada have been studied since 1980's \autocites{ZamoraCamacho1984EvolucionEstacional,ZamoraBareaAzcon2015LongTermChanges,BareaAzconetal2012PasseriformesOtras}. A total of 73 species of passerine bird species has been recorded using these oak forests \autocites{PerezLuqueetal2016DatasetPasserine}. Recent analysis shown differences in diversity between Sierra Nevada oak populations, with lower diversity values for southern oak populations than for northern-ones \autocites{PerezLuqueetal2021ManualGestion}. No differences was found for bird abundance, but a general decrease of several key species (\emph{Garrulus glandarius}) were recorded since 1980 \autocites{ZamoraBareaAzcon2015LongTermChanges}. 

Regarding the fungal community associated with this oak ecosystem, there are no studies analyzing the composition for oak populations of Sierra Nevada. However, several works have shown the richness associated to this ecosystem at regional and national scales. An exhaustive review of the diversity of mycorrhizae-forming macromycetes in the \emph{Quercus} forests of the Iberian Peninsula recorded 174 fungi  species in \Qp formations \autocites{Ortegaetal2010MycorrhizalMacrofungi}, of which 5 are included in the Red List of Fungi to be Protected in the Iberian Peninsula. At regional level, the IMBA, \emph{Inventario Micológico Básico de Andalucía} (Basic Mycological Inventory of Andalusia), reported 214 records belonging to 149 fungi taxa, inhabit in \Qp ecosystem \autocites{MorenoArroyo2004InventarioMicologico}. 

Several studies have analyzed the microbial diversity in the soils of some oak forests in the Sierra Nevada highlighting that the microbial community of this formation is dominated by a few very abundant taxa \autocites{CoboDiaz2017,Lasaetal2019BacteriaEndosphere, Lasaetal2019MetabarcodingReveals}. Finally, with respect to genetic diversity, it has been traditionally assumed that continued coppicing of \Qp over centuries has led to a decline in the genetic diversity of the species, as a result of the strong inter-stem competition and the propagation of a limited number of genotypes 
\autocites{SanchezPalomaresetal2008EstacionesEcologicas,Bravoetal2008SelviculturaMontes}. However, the results of several studies have pointed out the high diversity that these formations harbour \autocites{ValbuenaCarabanaGil2013GeneticResilience,ValbuenaCarabanaGil2013ReduceAprovechamiento,ValbuenaCarabanaGil2014EfectosGestion,ValbuenaCarabanaGil2017CentenaryCoppicing}. The high genetic diversity observed for the Sierra Nevada oak populations, highlights the importance of conserving the populations of this species which in this mountainous region are at the southern limit of their distribution, acting as a reservoir of genetic diversity. 

\subsection{Wine aging}\label{sec:es:provision-wine}
One of the characteristics of oak trees is their ability to emit volatile organic compounds (\emph{VOCs}), which in addition to giving the wines their characteristic flavor, act as an attractant for different insects. More than 50 volatile organic compounds belonging to 12 different chemical classes have been characterized in melojo oak \autocites{Ramiloetal2017VolatileOrganic}. The phenolic compounds produced by \Qp have similar chemical composition to those produced by the main oaks used in wine aging, such as American oak (\emph{Q. alba}) or French oak (\emph{Q. petraea}) \autocites{Gallegoetal2012PhenolicCompounds}. In fact, the results of comparative analysis between wines aged in barrels from these three oak species, have indicated that the wine aged in melojo oak presents oenological features similar to those of the other oaks, being also very positively valued by the wine tasters \autocites{CadahiaFernandezdeSimon2004UtilizacionRoble,FernandezdeSimonetal2008VolatileCompounds,FernandezdeSimonetal2009VolatileCompounds}. All these results highlight the potential use of wood and its derivatives from \Qp for wine aging, which had not been previously used in cooperage \autocites{Gallego2013EstudioPotencial,MartinezGiletal2020EffectSize} (\figref{fig:es:barrica}. 

\subsection{Tanning}\label{sec:es:provision-tanning}
The bark and leaves of the \Qp contain a great diversity of tannins \autocites{FernandezdeSimonetal2006ChemicalCharacterization,Doceetal2007EffectImmature}. Due to the high percentage of tannins present in this species (8\% of bark and 2-10\% of the wood corresponds to tannins), it has been used as a tanning agent for leather, particularly the bark \autocites{TornerOchoa1952CurtientesVegetales}. In fact, \Qp has been one of the most appreciated species as a tanning agent since its bark contains higher percentages of tannins than other \emph{Quercus} species (8\% versus 2-3\%) \autocites{TornerOchoa1952CurtientesVegetales}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Edible fungi}\label{sec:es:provision-fungi}
Mycological resources have high ecological, social, recreational and economic importance contributing to increasing the environmental asset value of the forests \autocites{MartinezPenaetal2015RentaAmbiental}. Mushroom picking has increased since 1980s and is becoming a important recreational activity. For European countries, 152 species belonging to 12 genera of wild mushrooms are commonly collected \autocites{Schulpetal2014WildFood}. Data on mushroom production and use are scarce, scattered and heterogeneous. However there are several
initiatives that have carried out an initial assessment of this resource, such as the RECAMAN initiative in Andalusia (\emph{REnta and the CApital of the Montes de ANdalucía}; "Inncome and Capital of the Andalusian Mountains")\autocites{MartinezPenaetal2015RentaAmbiental}. Likewise, the "Plan CUSSTA" (\emph{Plan for the Sustainable Use and Conservation of Mushrooms and Truffles in Andalusia}) is carrying out periodic field sampling to determine the production of mushrooms in different forest formations in Andalusia \autocites{RayaLopezetal2017MuestreosPara}. Preliminary results for three years showed that in \Qp forests the main marketable species are: \emph{Amanita caesarea} (3.63 \khy), \emph{Boletus aereus} (4.73 \khy), \emph{Cantharellus subpruinosus} (7.8 \khy), \emph{Hydnum rufescens} (0.23 \khy), \emph{Lepista nuda} (0.1 \khy), \emph{Macrolepiota procera} (0.41 \khy) and \emph{Russula cyanoxantha} (0.03 kg \khy).

\end{figure}


\subsection{Timber production}\label{sec:es:provision-timber}

One of the main products provided by forests is wood. The wood of this species has not been appreciated as much as that of other oaks. However, it has been used to obtain firewood directly or for charcoal production \autocites{MontoyaMeson1979SituacionActual}. For instance, some of the oak populations of Sierra Nevada have been intensely exploited to obtain wood \autocites[\emph{e.g.} Robledal de Cáñar, Alpujarras,][]{ValbuenaCarabanaGil2013GeneticResilience,MorenoLlorca2016}. In addition, other uses of timber have been documented, such as its use in miniing in northernwestern slopes of Sierra Nevada \autocites{Titos1990}, where the timber of this species was used for mine tunnels and furnaces, and also as firewood to melt the mineral. All these heavy exploitations of timber provoked an alteration in the oak forests structrure \autocite{PerezLuqueetal2020LanduseLegacies}. Notwithstanding, since the 1970s, anthropogenic pressure on the forests has been reduced, which lead an increase of tree density, and also in the basal area and tree size \autocite{GonzalezDiazetal2020BosquesEspanoles}. This general pattern, observed for the forest of Iberian Peninsula \autocite{Astigarragaetal2020EvidenceNon,GonzalezDiazetal2020BosquesEspanoles}, has been also confirmed for Pyrenean oak forest. Using data from second and third Spanish National Forest Inventory \autocites{VillaescusaDiaz1998SegundoInventario,Villanueva2005TercerInventario}, the temporal variation on tree biomass of the \Qp forests was assessed \autocites{PerezLuqueetal2021CarbonSequestration} (see also chapter \ref{sec:carbon}). The results shown a total increase of 19 172 \mgha between the two national forest inventories, with most of the inventories plot showing an increase pattern (89\%). 


\section{Cultural services}\label{sec:es:cultural}
\subsection{Recreational values}\label{sec:es:cultural-recreation}
Nature recreation represents a valuable ecosystem service that has a substantial economic value and contributes considerably to income and employment of local communities \autocites{Schagneretal2017MonitoringRecreation}. Monitoring visitors to natural areas have been used to estimate the recreational values provided by several ecosystems \autocites{Andersenetal2014MonitoringVisitors,Schagneretal2017MonitoringRecreation}. We used data from pyroelectric sensors located in several areas of the Sierra Nevada Protected Area to monitor visitors to this mountain range. We selected data located on two singular oak woodlands of Sierra Nevada for which data are available: Dehesa del Camarate, popularly known as \emph{``Bosque Encantado''} (Enchanted Forests), and Vereda de la Estrella. We analyzed the annual profile of the visits (October 2018 to 2019), and compared the visits in the two oak woodlands with total visitors registered for all sensors installed in this mountain region (\emph{n} = 14). Preliminary results showed that those two oak woodlands have a high number of visits, particularly during autumn season, when they represent almost the total number of visits (\figref{fig:es:visitorsprofile}). 

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/es/es-visitorsprofile.pdf}\caption{Evolution of the visitors numbers in two oak woodlands, \emph{Dehesa del Camarate} (green), and \emph{Vereda de la Estrella} (blue), comparing with the total of Sierra Nevada (gray). Data come from automatic counters (pyroelectric sensors) located at different points in the Sierra Nevada.}\label{fig:es:visitorsprofile}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Recreational sports activities}\label{sec:es:cultural-sports}
One way to analyze the physical use of the landscape, and therefore its value as a provider of a cultural ecosystem service, consists of estimating the recreational activities performed in nature \autocites[][\emph{e.g.}]{RocesDiazetal2018AssessingDistribution}. We used the density of routes (hiking, biking, running and other types of outdoor activities) existing in the Wikiloc portal (www.wikiloc.com) (data query in January 2020) for all the municipalities belonging to the Sierra Nevada Natural Protected Area. For each municipality, the total number of routes, and the density (number of routes / surface area of the municipality in ha) were calculated. Each of the oak populations of Sierra Nevada were assigned to the municipalities in which they are present. Of the 47998 routes obtained for the Sierra Nevada mountain region, 49.94\% were in the 14 municipalities where oak woodland are present (\figref{fig:es:wikiloc}). The density of routes in these municipalities ranged from 5.24 - 41.8 routes km$^{-2}$ (\tabref{tab:es:wikiloc}) being for most of them much higher than the average density of routes of the Sierra Nevada municipalities (17.88 routes km$^{-2}$). In absolute terms, the municipalities of the Alpujarra have the highest number of routes.

\subsection{Scientific knowledge}\label{sec:es:cultural-scientific} 
To determine the importance of oak woodlands in the provision of the ecosystem service of scientific knowledge, we used two indicators related to research activities. First, we explore the spatial location of research activities conducted in Sierra Nevada during the period 2009-2013 \autocites{Zamoraetal2017MonitoringGlobal}. For this purpose, a database compiling the research authorization documents for the Sierra Nevada Protected Area, was used to generate a density map with the \emph{hotspots} areas of research activities for Sierra Nevada mountain area. Then we extracted the information for the oak populations. Most of the research authorizations are concentrated in the western side of the Sierra Nevada (\figref{fig:es:scientific}b) particularly in the high summits area. The mean values of research permissions for oak woodlands in the period studied was 3.03 ± 0.06, with Genil oak population (northwestern), and the Cáñar (southern) oak populations, contains the high concentration of research requests (\figref{fig:es:scientific}b). 
Secondly, we explored a density map of sampling protocols deployed in the Sierra Nevada \autocites{Zamoraetal2017MonitoringGlobal} using data from Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory \autocites{Zamoraetal2016GlobalChange}. All the social-ecological monitoring protocols within this initiative were geolocated to generate a concentration map of sampling protocols by applying geostatistical hotspot detection techniques (Kernel density estimation) \autocites[][see]{Zamoraetal2016GlobalChange} (\figref{fig:es:scientific}a). The results show that the oak woodlands are located in areas of high density of scientific activity (both sampling protocol density and research requested areas) in comparison with the other forest ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada.

For both maps the spatial bounding boxes of each oak population are shown. Drawn from \autocites{Zamoraetal2017MonitoringGlobal,Zamoraetal2016GlobalChange}}\label{fig:es:scientific}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Aesthetic values}\label{sec:es:cultural-aesthetic} 
Using data from the Flickr platform (www.flickr.com), \citet{MorenoLlorcaetal2020EvaluatingTourist} assessed some of the cultural services offered in Sierra Nevada. Of the total of 778 photographs analyzed, 18 are geolocated in oak woodlands (\figref{fig:es:flicker}). This value is low with respect to the total number of photographs analyzed, mainly due to the fact that the highest density of photos in the dataset analyzed is located around the ski resort and village areas (mainly the Alpujarras) \autocites{RosCandeiraetal2020SocialMedia}. Likewise, when we explore the various ecosystems in which the photos are located, we observe a higher concentration of photos in the high mountain areas. If we explore forest ecosystems (\emph{i.e.} native pine, holm oak, Pyrenean oak forests, and pine plantations), the photos taken in Pyrenean oak forests represent 32\% of the total.

\subsection{Singular trees}\label{sec:es:cultural-trees} 
Singular and/or monumental trees perform key ecological functions \autocites[\emph{e.g.} nutrient cycling; support complex assemblages of species,][]{Zapponietal2017RoleMonumental}. They have important impacts on the distribution and abundance of many other entities, from water and nutrients to whole organisms (fungi, other plants and numerous animal species) \autocites{LindenmayerLaurance2017EcologyDistribution}. Furthermore, they are creditors of natural value \emph{perse} \autocites{Asciutoetal2016MonumentalTrees}, and are considered part of a social realm, providing numerous socio-cultural benefits to society \autocites{BlicharskaMikusinski2014IncorporatingSocial,MoyaMoya2013MonumentalTrees}. Singular trees provide humans with aesthetic, symbolic, religious and historical values, as well as concrete tangible benefits, such as leaves, branches or nuts \autocites{BlicharskaMikusinski2014IncorporatingSocial}. They can be considered as single trees by their dasometric (height, diameter at breast height), age, and socio-cultural characteristics (\emph{e.g.} surrounding landscape, local myths, legends and traditions, witnessing historical events), so their conservation could contribute to the protection of both ecological and also social values. \autocites{BlicharskaMikusinski2014IncorporatingSocial}. 

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/es/es-flicker.pdf}\caption{Location of photos taken in Sierra Nevada uploaded to the Flickr platform (\emph{n} = 778). Black dots indicate photos located in oak woodland. Drawn with data from \citet{RosCandeiraetal2020SocialMedia}. 
}\label{fig:es:flicker}
\end{figure}
 
There are several specimens of \Qp in Sierra Nevada considered singular and/or monumental because of their extraordinary dimensions \autocite{IruritaFernandezetal2003ArbolesArboledas}, reaching tree heights of up to 19.5 meters and base perimeter of 6.7 meters. They are located in Busquístar (Alpujarras, southern slopes of Sierra Nevada). There are also other species singular trees located in the surroundings of some oak populations that add an ecosystem value to these oak populations, since these specimens are visited by hikers. For instance, in the Vereda de la Estrella (Güejar Sierra) there are majestic specimens of chestnut (\emph{Castanea sativa}), with a fomous tree known as "El Abuelo" ("The grandpa") standing more than 20 m high and with a perimeter at the base of 10.7 m. Likewise, there are some oak woodlands in Sierra Nevada that shelter specimens and/or singular populations of other species. For instance, the Abedular del Barranco de los Alisos, located in the Dúrcal oak woodland 150. It is a small grove of about 300 individuals of birch (\emph{Betula pendula} subsp. \emph{fontqueri}) with an average height of 12 m. Other examples are the grove of birch trees located at the "Barranco de los Alisos", in the Dúrcal melojo population 150; or the Aliseda de la Cueva del Santo, where there are more than 100 alders (\emph{Alnus glutinosa}) accompanied by melojo oak and chestnut trees. In Andalusia region, there are also other melojo stands catalogued as singular, such as those located in the Sierra del Aljibe, whose specimens do not stand out for their dimensions but their location is unique and of great interest \autocite{SanchezGarciaetal2003ArbolesArboledas}, representing a southern limit of distribution of the species.

\subsection{Spatial pattern for Ecosystem Services of Sierra Nevada}\label{sec:es:spatial} 

The availability of data for several ecosystem services allowed us to compare differences in the provision of ecosystem services between the oak population clusters \autocite[N: Northern, NW: Northwestern, and S: Southern; see][]{PerezLuqueetal2021EcologicalDiversity}. Regarding the regulation services evaluated, we observed that the southern populations have higher values for carbon sequestration potential, mean EVI and soil organic carbon than for the other clusters (\figref{fig:es:oak-compare}). For cultural ecosystem services, the NW populations present high values for sports activities, number of visitors, and density of sampling protocols (scientific value). Finally, for provisioning and support services we observed a variable pattern depending on the ecosystem service evaluated. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/es/es-plotSN.pdf}\caption{Comparison of ecosystem services (cultural: yellow; regulation: blue; supporting: gray) for oak populations cluster identified in Sierra Nevada. See Table \tabref{tab:es:oak-cluster} for a detailed description 
}\label{fig:es:oak-compare}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Concluding remarks}\label{sec:es:spatial} 
In this work we combined a literature review with expert criterion to identify the ecosystem services provide by \Qp woodlands The literature review revealed the existence of a large number of works related to wine ageing, highlighting the potential of this species for wine production (\tabref{tab:es:wos}). It is striking that no work has been found in our literature review that evaluates cultural services in this woodland forests. However, this pattern changes when the ecosystem services are analyzed in more detail as in our case study. Thus, the combination of expert criteria with data at a more local scale allowed us to highlight the existence of a large number of cultural ecosystem services provided by \Qp woodlands. For instance, the \Qp woodlands of Sierra Nevada represent a high percentage of the visitors registered by different sensors in Sierra Nevada (\figref{fig:es:visitorsprofile}, highlighting also the temporal character of this ecosystem service.
