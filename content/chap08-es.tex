\paragraph{Abstract} \mbox{} \\
\Qpy (melojo) forests are relevant part of the Iberian landscape and have suffered intense anthropic pressures causing modifications in their structure and composition. Historically they were exploited in coppice for charcoal, firewood, or they were thinned and even burned to create grazing areas. Abandonment of traditional exploitation since the middle of the last century has led to a decrease in anthropic pressure on these ecosystems. Paradoxically, some of these oak woodlands present a state of advanced degradation (stagnation of growth; scarce regeneration; etc), with stands with high densities and high biomass accumulation, increasing the fire risk. Taking into account this situation, and considering the vulnerability of this species to global change, it is necessary to find alternatives to the traditional uses of coppice management, particularly for those stands located in their rear edge, such us the oak woodlands of Sierra Nevada (southern Spain), due to their relevance for the species conservation. In this work we present a comprehensive review of the main ecosystem services (ES) provided by melojo oak forests. Then, using the Sierra Nevada (SN) melojo oak populations as study-case, we explore more in depth the ES provided by these woodlands. We combined expert knowledge and datasets from different sources (\emph{e.g.} grey literature, monitoring programs) to quantify the ES provided by these forests. We also explored the spatio-temporal pattern of some ES among the melojo oak populations within SN mountain range. Provisioning (\emph{e.g.} use of melojo oak wood in the wine production) and regulating services (\emph{e.g.} carbon sequestration and soil fertility) were widely reported in the literature review meanwhile no studies assessing cultural ES were found in our literature review. However, this pattern changes when the ES were analyzed in more detail as in our study case, highlighting the existence of diverse cultural services provided these forests in SN. We found differences among the supply of ES within the melojo oak populations, with southern populations have higher values of regulating services and northern ones exhibited higher values for cultural services. A temporal variation in the supply of ES of melojo forests was observed. Until the middle of the last century, provisioning services predominated over regulating and cultural services (poor valued). The abandonment of traditional activities led to a decrease of provisioning services in favor of regulating services, and in the last decades, cultural services. Our compilation of local scale data has allowed us to quantify many of ES supplied by the \Qp forests, which could aid to natural resource managers with more information and tools to help them in the decision-making process.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:es:intro}

Mediterranean forests are subjected to significant and simultaneous climatic and anthropogenic pressures \autocite{FAOPlanBleu2018StateMediterranean,DoblasMirandaetal2017ReviewCombination}, and climate change is expected to strongly affect the Mediterranean Region \autocite{GiorgiLionello2008ClimateChange,Crameretal2018ClimateChange,Crameretal2020ClimateEnvironmental}. Besides, the impacts of global change on Mediterranean forest ecosystems are altering the provision of ecosystem services \autocite{Lindneretal2010ClimateChange,Lindneretal2014ClimateChange,NoceSantini2018MediterraneanForest,Penuelasetal2017ImpactsGlobal,SerradaHierroetal2011ImpactosVulnerabilidad} particularly in mountainous regions, which have shown a high vulnerability to climate change \autocite{Schroteretal2005EcosystemService}. Notwithstanding, Mediterranean forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services (ES), and represent a great asset and opportunities for the future of the Mediterranean basin \autocite{Gauquelinetal2018MediterraneanForests,NoceSantini2018MediterraneanForest}. Hence, the importance of Mediterranean forests derives both from their current value in terms of area and goods and services, and from the potential role they are likely to play in the future as providers of ES \autocites{FAOPlanBleu2018StateMediterranean}.

Among the Mediterranean type forests, the oak woodlands, \emph{i.e.}, those dominated by oak tree species (\emph{e.g.} \emph{Quercus ilex}, \emph{Q. suber}, \emph{Q. robur}, \emph{Q. faginea}, \emph{Q. petraea}, \emph{Q. pubescens}, \emph{Q. pyrenaica}, \emph{Q. canariensis}) are key ecosystems providing variety of ES \autocite{Maranonetal2020IberianOaks}. For example, their capacity to sequester carbon and therefore to regulate the climate and to mitigate the effects of climatic change is a remarkable regulating service. Oak forests contribute to soil fertility and to the regulation of air, soil and water quality \autocite{Maranonetal2012EstadoTendencia}. These woodlands also provide several raw materials: cork, firewood, acorns \autocite{Bugalhoetal2011MediterraneanCork}. In addition, their role as providers of a wide variety of cultural services, such as recreational, aesthetic and spiritual has been also highlighted \autocite{Lofetal2016ManagementOak}. To conserve these forests and their biodiversity, and to manage them in a sustainable way, it is important to be aware of their real and potential supply of ES.

\subsubsection{The case of melojo woodlands (\Qpy) in the Western Mediterranean Region}\label{sec:es:intro-qp}
\Qpw (Pyrenean oak, \emph{melojo}) is a marcescent tree species widely distributed throughout southwestern France and the Iberian Peninsula with some populations at the mountain areas of northern Morocco \autocites{Franco1990Quercus} (\figref{fig:es:location}). In the Iberian Peninsula, these forests (in this chapter we will refer to \Qpy forests as \emph{melojo} oaklands or \emph{melojo} woodlands) occupy siliceous soils under meso-supramediterranean and mesotemperate areas and subhumid, humid, and hyperhumid ombroclimate \autocites{delaSernaetal2016MarcescentQuercus,Gavilanetal2018SclerophyllousDeciduous}. The rear-edge populations of this species are restricted to high-mountain areas where they persist as isolated nuclei with ecological conditions very different from those of the main distribution area \autocites{PerezLuqueetal2021EcologicalDiversity}. Sierra Nevada mountains (37°N, 3°W, Spain) represent one of the southernmost European limits for this species (Figure \ref{fig:es:location}b). In this mountain area, considered a glacial refuge for deciduous \emph{Quercus} species \autocite{Olaldeetal2002WhiteOaks}, there are eight melojo oak patches, occupying a total of 2400 ha, and ranging from 1100 to 2000 \emph{m.a.s.l.}. Among the forest ecosystems in Sierra Nevada, melojo woodlands are the richest regarding vascular plant species, containing a large number of endemic and endangered plant species \autocite{Loriteetal2008PhytosociologicalReview}. They also harbor high levels of intraspecific genetic diversity \autocite{ValbuenaCarabanaGil2013GeneticResilience,ValbuenaCarabanaGil2017CentenaryCoppicing}. 

\Qp woodlands, like other forests in Mediterranean area, have been subjected to intense anthropogenic pressures over time \autocite{GarciaJimenez20099230Robledales}, resulting in a reduction of their extension and a modification of their floristic composition \autocites{Serradaetal1992CoppiceSystem,Gavilanetal2000EffectsDisturbance,PerezLuqueetal2021EcologicalDiversity} and of their structural patterns \autocites{Calvoetal1999PostfireSuccession,Tarregaetal2006ForestStructure}. Historically, these woodlands have been exploited in coppices for obtaining several products such as firewood, charcoal, tannins, casca (\emph{i.e.} parts of the bark used to extract tannins), and many other traditional uses \autocites{RuizdelaTorre2006FloraMayor,SanchezPalomaresetal2008EstacionesEcologicas}. For instance, after the Spanish Civil war (since 1940's), some oak woodlands were massively cut down to use the firewood as fuel for automobiles (\emph{e.g.} Dehesa de San Jerónimo, Sierra Nevada)\autocite{Prieto1975BosquesSierra}. Forest management for coppices consisted of clear-cutting in rotation periods of 12-20 years, causing the profusion of shoots from the stool highly appreciated by livestock \autocite{Bravoetal2008SelviculturaMontes}. Thinning  and sometimes even burned have also been carried out to create pastures with low densities of mature trees that provide acorns, firewood and large areas for grazing \autocites{HerreraCalvo2016UsoPastoral,Alvarezetal2009CambiosEstructura,ValbuenaCarabanaGil2017CentenaryCoppicing}. In fact, overgrazing in these formations have caused strong soil erosion loss, which was noticed by forest managers since the end of the 19\textsuperscript{th} century \autocites{Laguna1872ComisionFlora}. In some areas, the strong anthropic pressure provoked the loss of the forest cover. For instance, in southern slopes of Sierra Nevada mountains, oak woodlands were almost completely removed at the beginning of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century, which led to some of its watershed being considered among the most torrential in Spain \autocites{RomeroZurbano1909DivisionHidrologicoforestal}. All these anthropogenic processes have transformed the melojo woodlands in a deep way that it is difficult to find stands that can be considered natural forests \autocites{RuizdelaTorre2006FloraMayor}. 

The abandonment of livestock and forestry traditional uses since the middle of the last century due to rural abandonment \autocites{MacDonaldetal2000AgriculturalAbandonment}, has caused a decrease in anthropogenic pressure on Mediterranean forests, being particularly important for mountain areas \autocites{JimenezOlivenciaetal2015MedioSiglo,JimenezOlivenciaetal2015EvolucionUsos,Piasetal2014ColonizationAbandoned,ValbuenaCarabanaetal2010HistoricalRecent}. Paradoxically, and considering this decrease in anthropogenic pressure, many of the oak stands present a state of advanced degradation, showing growth stagnation, lack of fruiting, and also signs of branch dieback \autocites{Canellasetal2004GrowthResponse, Bravoetal2008SelviculturaMontes, ValbuenaCarabanaGil2014EfectosGestion, PiqueVericat2015EvolutionPerspectives, Piqueetal2018Spain}. Many stands, derived from the high resprout capacity of \Qp, also have high tree density that would increase their vulnerability to drought, as has been reported in other forests across the world \autocite{McDowelletal2020PervasiveShifts}. The high tree density together with the accumulation of biomass and high horizontal continuity, would increase the risk of fire \autocites{Bravoetal2008SelviculturaMontes,GarciaJimenez20099230Robledales}. In addition, these problems may be aggravated in the current context of climate change (increase in temperatures and higher incidence of extreme events such as droughts) \autocites{IPCC2013ClimateChange,Spinonietal2018WillDrought}, particularly considering the high vulnerability of this species to climate change \autocites{Benitoetal2011SimulatingPotential,GarciaValdesetal2013ChasingMoving,SanchezdeDiosetal2009PresentFuture,GeaIzquierdoetal2013GrowthProjections}, and especially for areas located in the rear edge of their distribution range such as Sierra Nevada mountain range.

In view of this current situation of vulnerable (to global change drivers) forest stands, affected by the progressive abandonment of traditional land uses during the last decades, the need of defining alternative uses for melojo oak woodlands has been pointed out \autocites{MesonMontoya1985VegetacionForestal,SanMigueletal2012BosquesMatorrales}, and some management alternatives have been proposed \autocite[\emph{e.g.} sylvopastoral uses, see][]{HerreraCalvo2016UsoPastoral}. Melojo woodlands are human-shaped ecosystems with high conservation value, and consequently, management is required to guide their development \autocite{Hobbsetal2006NovelEcosystems}. In this sense, the identification and characterization of the main ES and their spatio-temporal pattern, becomes a crucial to develop landscape planning and forest management strategies in a global change context \autocites{Piqueetal2018Spain}. 

Ecosystem services provided by melojo woodlands depend on the intensity of human use. Both overuse and abandonment of melojo woodlands provided very different scenarios for the provision of ES and for the socioeconomic demand for them. Despite the wide variety of ES provided by oaklands is worldwide acknowledged, very little has been written specifically about the provision of ES by oak-dominated forests \autocites{Maranonetal2012OakTrees,Maranonetal2012EstadoTendencia,MorenoLlorcaetal2012MontanaMediterranea}. Some works have carried out a general valuation of the ES provided by the different \emph{Quercus} woodlands at regional and national scales \autocite{SanMigueletal2012BosquesMatorrales,Maranonetal2012EstadoTendencia,Sousaetal2020EcosystemServices}, and some studies provided temporal trend analysis of ES from an economic perspective \autocites[see][for an example for woodland pastures of California and Spain]{Caparrosetal2013EconomicsEcosystem}. However, to our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review of the ES provided by \Qp woodlands. 

The aim of this work is to carry out a review of the main ES provided by \Qp woodlands. Firstly, we conducted a literature review to know the general state of the art and to summarize some of the most relevant ES provided by these formations. Secondly, using the Sierra Nevada oak populations as study-case we explore more in depth the ES provided by these woodlands. For this purpose, we combined expert knowledge and a wide variety of data coming from ecological monitoring programs and several research projects to quantify as far as possible the ES provided by these forests. We are also interested in exploring how the ES are spatially distributed in this mountain region. For this, we searched for differences on the supply of ES between the melojo oak populations within Sierra Nevada mountain range.  Finally, using time series of several indicators, we have assessed the temporal changes of ES supply by \Qp in our study area.

\section{Material and methods}\label{sec:es:mat}
\subsubsection{Study area}\label{sec:es:mat-studyarea}
Sierra Nevada is a mountainous region located in the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula  (37º14'-36º54'N; 2º37'-3º39'W) covering more than 2000 km\textsuperscript{2} with an elevation range of between 860 and 3482 \emph{m.a.s.l.}. The climate is Mediterranean, characterized by cold winters and hot summers, with a pronounced summer drought. The annual average temperature decreases in altitude from 12-16 ºC below 1500 \emph{m.a.s.l.} to 0 ºC above 3000 \emph{m.a.s.l.}. Annual precipitation ranges from less than 250 mm in the lowest areas of the mountain range to more than 700 mm in the highest peaks. Winter precipitation is mainly in the form of snow above 2000 \emph{m.a.s.l.}. Topographically, the area is heterogeneous, with strong climatic contrasts between the sunny, dry south-facing slopes and the shaded, wetter north-facing slopes. This mountain range is considered one of the most important biodiversity hotspots in the Mediterranean region \autocite{Blancaetal1998ThreatenedVascular}, hosting 105 endemic plant species for a total of 2353 taxa of vascular plants (33\% and 20\% of Spanish and European flora, respectively) \autocite{Lorite2016UpdatedChecklist}. Forest cover in Sierra Nevada is dominated by pine plantations (\emph{Pinus halepensis} Mill., \emph{Pinus pinaster} Ait., \emph{Pinus nigra} Arnold subsp. \emph{salzmannii} (Dunal) Franco, and \emph{Pinus sylvestris} L.) covering approximately 37000 ha. Native forests are mainly dominated by holm oak (\emph{Quercus ilex} subsp. \emph{ballota} (Desf.) Samp.) occupying low and medium mountain areas, and melojo oak ranging from 1100 to 2000 \emph{m.a.s.l.} \autocite{PerezLuqueetal2019MapEcosystems}.

\subsubsection{Selection of ecosystem services and their assessment }\label{sec:es:mat-selection}
To analyze the ES provided by melojo forests, we have carried out two different phases. Firstly, we performed a general literature review to explore the state of the art on the ES provided by these forests regardless of their specific location. Secondly, considering the results of the general literature review, we have carried out a more comprehensive analysis of the ES provided by the melojo forests in Sierra Nevada. We have characterized their supply for Sierra Nevada mountain region, and where data were available, we have quantified them, and compared between melojo populations identified in Sierra Nevada. Finally, we explored temporal evolution of indicators for several ES when data were available. For the classification and definition of ecosystem services, we used the CICES V5.1 (Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services) approach \autocites{HainesYoungPotschin2018CommonInternational}. We have considered three categories of ecosystem services: provisioning, regulating and cultural, and for each of them, we have identified different ES indicators. Due to the large number of ES studied, we have considered it more practical to explain for each of the ES, the indicator(s) used to quantify it (see details in the following section).  

To characterize the scientific literature that evaluate the ES of the melojo oak woodlands, we performed initially a systematic search in the ISI Web of Knowledge (search date: October 2020). We compiled references published in indexed journals included in the Journal of Citation Reports (JCR), in English language, since 1970 to 2020, that evaluated a wide variety of ES indicators in these woodlands. First, we conducted a search for papers on the study species with the term \emph{"Quercus pyrenaica"} in the title, keywords or abstract, which produced 393 results. We applied a second criterion, to extract papers that analyzed possible services, including a broad list of terms (also in the title, keywords or abstract) related to ES
(\tabref{tab:es:wos}). The combination of both produced 188 results. After reviewing their abstracts, we selected 60 papers that met the premise of evaluating ES in melojo oak woodlands (\tabref{tab:es-review}). We omitted papers focused exclusively on descriptive aspects of these ecosystems (\emph{e.g.} floristic composition or ecosystem structure), their biodiversity (\emph{e.g.} species richness) which were not directly related to ecosystem service indicators. 

For each of the ES reviewed, we initially described the general status of the services in these woodlands using the compiled references. Then, we performed a quantification for the Sierra Nevada oak woodland populations, when data were available. The values for the quantification were obtained both from the literature review and from several research datasets in combination with the expert criterion (\tabref{tab:es:data}). For those ES with data availability, we performed a quantification using a spatiotemporal approach: \emph{i)} we assessed how ES provision varies across the space in each of the oak population clusters identified in Sierra Nevada (\emph{i.e.} Northern (N), Northwestern (NW), and Southern (S)) \autocite[ see][]{PerezLuqueetal2021EcologicalDiversity}; and \emph{ii)} we explored the temporal variation in the provision of ES using available time series of several indicators of ES (\tabref{tab:es:temporal}).

\section{Ecosystem Services provided by \Qp woodlands}\label{sec:es:results}
The compilation of literature carried out has shown us those services that have been most frequently evaluated in works focused on \Qp woodlands (see \tabref{tab:es:wos}). Provisioning services were the most frequently ES evaluated within the 60 papers selected in the literature review. Among them, the studies focused on investigating the effect of melojo wood in the wine production process stand out (\emph{n} = 26/60) \autocites[\emph{e.g.}][]{FernandezdeSimonetal2010CharacterizationVolatile,CastroVazquezetal2013EvaluationPortuguese}, since barrels are frequently built with the wood of this species. In addition, we found different studies evaluating mushroom production \autocites[\emph{e.g.}][]{OriadeRuedaetal2010CouldArtificial}, the effect of this species on livestock production \autocites[\emph{e.g.}][]{Nunezetal2012LivestockManagement}, or the production of wood or biomass for energy (\emph{n} = 6/60) \autocites[\emph{e.g.}][]{Mirandaetal2009EnergeticCharacterization}. Regarding regulation services, several studies assessed the role of forests in soil quality and fertility (\emph{n} = 12/60), or their capacity for carbon sequestration and storage \autocites[\emph{n} = 12/60; \emph{e.g.}][]{Alvarezetal2014InfluenceTree}. There also a high proportion of studies on soil carbon \autocites[\emph{n} = 8/60; \emph{e.g.}][]{Fonsecaetal2019ImpactTree}. Finally, it should be noted that, applying the above-mentioned search criteria, no studies on the evaluation of cultural services in the melojo woodlands have been found.

\subsection{Regulating services}\label{sec:es:regulation}
\subsubsection{Soil climate regulation}\label{sec:es:regulation-soil}

Tree canopy cover is key to regulate soil temperature \autocite{Ellisonetal2017TreesForests}, which is one of the main factors affecting ecological functions such as seed germination or plant growth and development, and being as important as air temperature, since it can limit root formation \autocites{AlvarezUriaKorner2007LowTemperature}. The marcescent feature of \Qp allows the accumulation of leaf litter layer on the ground during a part of the year. This accumulation can have positive effects on seedling establishment because it acts as a thermal insulator \autocites{Loydietal2014DistributionEffects}, helping to alleviate the damage effects of freezing on seeds \autocites{Loydietal2014DistributionEffects,CavenderBaresetal2005SummerWinter,EstesoMartinezGilPelegrin2004FrostResistance,Lofetal2019TammReview}. This buffer effect can also be important once germination starts, since negative temperatures can suspend the process and damage the radicle and epicotyl \autocites{AizenWoodcock1996EffectsAcorn}. However, negative effects on seed germination and establishment could prevail (\emph{e.g.} pathogen proliferation; allelopathic effects) when litter accumulation exceeds a certain threshold \autocites{Loydietal2014DistributionEffects,XiongNilsson1999EffectsPlant}. 

It has also been noticed the importance of the forest cover on the regulation of extremes temperatures registered during the summer period \autocites{DeFrenneetal2021ForestMicroclimates}. This cover provides a cooler environment, reducing potential evapotranspiration and alleviating the water stress to which these formations are subjected in summer \autocite{Zamoraetal2021UniendoMacro}. This can be particularly important for populations located at the warm rear-edge of the species distribution, such as the studied here. For instance, using microclimatic data from a sensor network deployed in a melojo oak stand located at southern slopes of Sierra Nevada, \citet{Zamoraetal2021UniendoMacro} found strong variations of the air and soil temperatures registered inside the forest compared with those registered on forest's open areas. The soil temperatures varied up to 15ºC between microhabitats on a day of maximum temperatures during the summer period. 

\subsubsection{Climatic regulation: carbon sequestration and storage}\label{sec:es:regulation-carbon}

The role of forest ecosystems on climate regulation by storing and sequestering large amounts of carbon is widely acknowledge \autocites{Gauquelinetal2018MediterraneanForests,NoceSantini2018MediterraneanForest}. In the Mediterranean region, forests carbon stocks have increased for decades and this process is expected to continue in the future \autocites{Canellasetal2017CarbonSequestration}, although recent studies have shown a potential slowing down related to the increases in forest stand development levels in Mediterranean forests \autocite{RocesDiazetal2021TemporalChanges}. 

Recently, a thematic mapping of the biomass and carbon sequestration potential of woodlands of Sierra Nevada has been generated \autocites{PerezLuqueetal2021CarbonSequestration} (see also chapter \ref{sec:carbon}). These authors, combining remotely obtained information from aerial LIDAR (\emph{Light Detection And Ranging}) with information from field work, estimated a total biomass (aboveground- and belowground-biomass) of 9.94 Tg (1 Tg = 10$^{12}$ g) in the forests of the Sierra Nevada, which represents a sequestration of 17.33 Tg of CO$_2$.  

In addition to their relevance on carbon storage, the soil organic carbon (SOC) is particularly relevant for different soil processes, and it is involved in different ES, among which regulating and provisioning services stand out \autocites{Francavigliaetal2018OrganicCarbon}. For example, SOC content correlates positively with soil fertility, playing a key role determining the physical, chemical and biological qualities of a soil \autocites{Victoriaetal2012BenefitsSoil}. There are no studies quantifying SOC in Sierra Nevada oak melojo populations \autocites[but see][for puntual estimation]{CoboDiazetal2017TaxonomicFunctional}. We used the SoilGrid database (https://soilgrids.org/) which provided map of estimated SOC at a 250-m spatial resolution \autocites{Hengletal2017SoilGrids250mGlobal,Batjesetal2017WoSISProviding,Batjesetal2020StandardisedSoil}. For Sierra Nevada, this dataset reported an average SOC content (mean SOC at 0-30 cm depth) of 51.8 Mg ha$^{-1}$ (20-80 Mg ha$^{-1}$) (Figure \ref{fig:es:socwikiloc}a), while the oak forests have an average SOC value of 53.5 Mg ha$^{-1}$ (45-67 Mg ha$^{-1}$), with southern oaks populations showing significantly higher values than northern ones.

\subsubsection{Erosion control}\label{sec:es:regulation-erosion}
Forests play a key role in the reduction of the erosive rainfall impact on soil, that is a very important regulating service. The root system of \Qp consists of two well-differentiated types \autocites{Allue1995OrdenacionMasas}: \emph{(i)} the main root, characteristic of the genus, which allows for powerful anchoring to the soil; and \emph{(ii)} a layer of roots close to the soil surface and parallel to it, which could emit large number of shoots that form a dense network. These root systems help to maintain soil integrity by preserving landslides \autocites{MesonMontoya1985VegetacionForestal,Salomonetal2017GeneralFailure} (Figure \ref{fig:es:rootsfungi}a). In addition, the extraordinary regrowth capacity of \Qp, both of stump and roots, gives it functional advantages over other species, such as its response to disturbances (\emph{e.g.}, fires), particularly on sloping areas \autocites{RuizdelaTorre2006FloraMayor,ValbuenaCarabanaGil2017CentenaryCoppicing}. This resprouts profusion is key on soil protection, reducing the impact of erosive processes and the soil loss \autocites{MesonGarcia1984BasesEcologicas}.

\subsection{Supporting and provisioning services}\label{sec:es:provision}
\subsubsection{Biodiversity}\label{sec:es:provision-biodiversity}

\Qp forests in Sierra Nevada have high values of phytosociological uniqueness \autocites{Loriteetal2008PhytosociologicalReview}, which could be explained because they act as habitat providers for other relict species \autocites{Blancaetal1998ThreatenedVascular,Lorite2016UpdatedChecklist,Losaetal1986PaisajeVegetal}. In fact, the role of refugee of Sierra Nevada for this oak ecosystem \autocites{Breweretal2002SpreadDeciduous,Olaldeetal2002WhiteOaks,RodriguezSanchezetal2010TreeRange}, translates into a great diversity of plant species, being the forest formation with the greatest richness in Sierra Nevada, although it only represents 7\% of the forest areas \autocites{PerezLuqueetal2014SinfonevadaDataset}. \Qp woodlands in Sierra Nevada provide optimal conditions for the presence of several plant species, some of which are cataloged under different threatened categories at regional level \autocites{Lorite2016UpdatedChecklist,Losaetal1986PaisajeVegetal,MelendoValle2000EstudioComparativo}, such as the hybrid mustard (\emph{Sorbus hybrida} L.) considered critically endangered (CR), the endangered (EN) goat willow (\emph{Salix caprea} L.), the holly (\emph{Ilex aquifolium} L.) and the yew (\emph{Taxus baccata} L.) considered vulnerable (VU), and others with a lower level of threat (\emph{e.g.} near threat, NT) (\emph{e.g.} the rowan, \emph{Sorbus aria} (L.) Crantz; or the maple \emph{Acer opalus} subsp. \emph{granatense} (Boiss.) Font Quer \& Rothm.). Many of these species are also considered relict species that find favorable microclimatic conditions in the melojo oak woodlands of Sierra Nevada, which make them a refuge for those species.

Birds populations of \Qp forests of Sierra Nevada have been studied since 1980's \autocites{ZamoraCamacho1984EvolucionEstacional,ZamoraBareaAzcon2015LongTermChanges,BareaAzconetal2012PasseriformesOtras}. A total of 73 species of passerine bird species has been recorded within these oak forests \autocites{PerezLuqueetal2016DatasetPasserine}. Recent analysis shown differences in their diversity between Sierra Nevada oak populations, with lower values for southern oak populations than for northern-ones \autocites{PerezLuqueetal2021ManualGestion}. No differences was found for bird abundance, but a general decrease of several key species (\emph{Garrulus glandarius}) were recorded since 1980 \autocites{ZamoraBareaAzcon2015LongTermChanges}. 

Although there are no studies analyzing specifically the fungal composition of oak forests in Sierra Nevada, several works have shown the richness associated to the fungal communities of this type of forests at regional and national scales. Thus, an exhaustive review of the diversity of mycorrhizae-forming macromycetes in the \emph{Quercus} forests of the Iberian Peninsula recorded 174 fungi species in \Qp formations \autocites{Ortegaetal2010MycorrhizalMacrofungi}, of which five are included in the Red List of Fungi to be Protected in the Iberian Peninsula. At regional level, the Basic Mycological Inventory of Andalusia (IMBA, \emph{Inventario Micológico Básico de Andalucía}), reported 214 records belonging to 149 fungi taxa, inhabit in \Qp forests \autocites{MorenoArroyo2004InventarioMicologico}. 

Trees provide a diversity of habitats in which other species can live. For instance, \emph{Quercus} species are key in the development of the biological cycle of some insects, such us the oak gall wasp (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae). The galls support species-rich, closed communities of inquilines and parasitoids that have become a model system in community ecology \autocites{Stoneetal2002PopulationBiology}. For instance, in melojo forests of Sierra Nevada have been recorded 30 species of cynipids (representing 21\% of the Iberian species of this family) \autocites{NievesAldrey2013AvispasAgallas}. There are not many studies on the diversity that can be found in \Qp forest soils. In Sierra Nevada, some studies have reported that microbial community of melojo oak forests is dominated by a few very abundant taxa \autocites{CoboDiazetal2017TaxonomicFunctional,Lasaetal2019BacteriaEndosphere, Lasaetal2019MetabarcodingReveals}.

Finally, in relation to the genetic diversity within species, it has been traditionally assumed that continued coppicing of over centuries has led to a decline in the genetic diversity of the \Qp, as a result of the strong inter-stem competition and the propagation of a limited number of genotypes \autocites{SanchezPalomaresetal2008EstacionesEcologicas,Bravoetal2008SelviculturaMontes}. However, several studies have pointed out the high diversity that Sierra Nevada \Qp populations harbor \autocites{ValbuenaCarabanaGil2013GeneticResilience,ValbuenaCarabanaGil2013ReduceAprovechamiento,ValbuenaCarabanaGil2014EfectosGestion,ValbuenaCarabanaGil2017CentenaryCoppicing}, highlighting the importance of conserving the populations of this species at the rear-edge of their distribution, since they act as a reservoir of genetic diversity.

\subsubsection{Wine aging and tanning}\label{sec:es:provision-wine}

A relevant characteristic of oak trees is their ability to emit volatile organic compounds (\emph{VOCs}), which in addition to giving the wines their characteristic flavor, act as an attractant for different insects. More than 50 volatile organic compounds belonging to 12 different chemical classes have been characterized in melojo oak \autocites{Ramiloetal2017VolatileOrganic}. The phenolic compounds produced by \Qp have similar chemical composition to those produced by the main oaks used in wine aging, such as American oak (\emph{Q. alba}) or French oak (\emph{Q. petraea}) \autocites{Gallegoetal2012PhenolicCompounds}. In fact, the results of comparative analysis between wines aged in barrels from these three oak species, have indicated that the wine aged in melojo oak presents oenological features similar to those of the other oaks, being also very positively valued by the wine tasters \autocites{CadahiaFernandezdeSimon2004UtilizacionRoble,FernandezdeSimonetal2008VolatileCompounds,FernandezdeSimonetal2009VolatileCompounds}. All these results highlight the current use of \Qp wood and its derivatives from for wine aging, which had not been previously used in cooperage \autocites{Gallego2013EstudioPotencial,MartinezGiletal2020EffectSize} (Figure \ref{fig:es:rootsfungi}b).

The bark and leaves of \Qp contain a great diversity and a high percentage of tannins (8\% of bark and 2-10\% of the wood corresponds to tannins) \autocites{FernandezdeSimonetal2006ChemicalCharacterization,Doceetal2007EffectImmature,TornerOchoa1952CurtientesVegetales}). For this reason, it has been used as a tanning agent for leather, particularly the bark, since it contains higher percentage of tannins than other \emph{Quercus} species (8\% versus 2-3\%) \autocites{TornerOchoa1952CurtientesVegetales}.

\subsubsection{Food provision: Edible fungi}\label{sec:es:provision-fungi}
Mycological resources have high ecological, social, recreational and economic importance contributing to increasing the environmental asset value of the forests \autocites{MartinezPenaetal2015RentaAmbiental}. Data on mushroom production and picking are scarce, scattered, and heterogeneous. However, several regional initiatives have carried out preliminary assessment of mycological resources of forests, such as the RECAMAN initiative in Andalusia ("Inncome and Capital of the Andalusian Mountains"; \emph{REnta and the CApital of the Montes de ANdalucía})\autocites{MartinezPenaetal2015RentaAmbiental}. Likewise, the "Plan CUSSTA" (\emph{Plan for the Sustainable Use and Conservation of Mushrooms and Truffles in Andalusia}) is carrying out periodic field sampling to determine the production of mushrooms in different forest formations in Andalusia \autocites{RayaLopezetal2017MuestreosPara}. Preliminary results for three years showed that in \Qp forests, the main marketable species are: \emph{Amanita caesarea} (3.63 \khy), \emph{Boletus aereus} (4.73 \khy), \emph{Cantharellus subpruinosus} (7.8 \khy), \emph{Hydnum rufescens} (0.23 \khy), \emph{Lepista nuda} (0.1 \khy), \emph{Macrolepiota procera} (0.41 \khy) and \emph{Russula cyanoxantha} (0.03 \khy).

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Timber and firewood}\label{sec:es:provision-timber}
The wood of \Qp has not been appreciated as much as that of other oaks for built, although it has been used to obtain firewood directly or for charcoal production \autocites{MontoyaMeson1979SituacionActual}. For instance, some of the oak populations of Sierra Nevada have been intensely historically exploited to obtain firewood \autocites[\emph{e.g.} Robledal de Cáñar,][]{ValbuenaCarabanaGil2013GeneticResilience,MorenoLlorcaetal2016HistoricalAnalysis}. In addition, other uses of timber have been documented in this mountain range, such as its use in mining in the northernwestern oak woodlands of Sierra Nevada ("Robledal de San Juan", Güejar-Sierra, Granada) where it was used for mine tunnels and furnaces, and also as firewood to melt the mineral \autocites{Titos1990}. All these intense exploitation of timber have altered structure of these forests \autocite{PerezLuqueetal2020LanduseLegacies}. Notwithstanding, since the 1970s, anthropogenic pressure has been reduced, which lead an increase of tree density, and also in the basal area and average tree size \autocite{GonzalezDiazetal2020BosquesEspanoles}. This general pattern, observed for most of the forests of the Iberian Peninsula \autocite{Astigarragaetal2020EvidenceNon,GonzalezDiazetal2020BosquesEspanoles}, has been also confirmed for melojo oak forests. Thus, using data from second and third Spanish NFI, \citet{PerezLuqueetal2021ManualGestion} (see also chapter \ref{sec:carbon}) assessed the temporal variation on tree biomass of the forests. This analysis showed a total increase of 19172 \mgha between the two campaigns, with most of the field plots showing an increase pattern on biomass (89\% of the plots). This increase could be considered an asset for local populations around the oak woodlands, who could use the forest for firewood extraction

\subsection{Cultural services}\label{sec:es:cultural}
\subsubsection{Recreational values}\label{sec:es:cultural-recreation}

Nature recreation represents a valuable ecosystem service that has a substantial economic value and contributes considerably to income and employment of local communities \autocites{Schagneretal2017MonitoringRecreation}. Monitoring visitors to natural areas have been used often to estimate their recreational values in many areas \autocites{Schagneretal2017MonitoringRecreation}. We used this type of data obtained directly from pyroelectric sensors located in places within Sierra Nevada Protected Area to monitor visitors to this mountain range. We selected two singular oak woodlands of Sierra Nevada for which data are available: Dehesa del Camarate, popularly known as "Bosque Encantado" (Enchanted Forests), and Vereda de la Estrella. We compared the visits in the two oak woodlands with total visitors registered for all sensors installed in this mountain range during a year (n = 14; October 2018 to October 2019). Preliminary results showed that those two oak woodlands have a high number of visits (41145 visitors representing 37.36\% of total of annual visitors registered), particularly during autumn season, when they represent almost the total number of visits (\figref{fig:es:visitorsprofile}). 

\subsubsection{Recreational sports activities}\label{sec:es:cultural-sports}
One way to analyze the physical use of the landscape, and therefore its value as a provider of this cultural service, consists of quantifying the recreational activities performed in nature \autocites[\emph{e.g.}][]{RocesDiazetal2018AssessingDistribution}. We used the density of routes (hiking, biking, running and other types of outdoor activities) existing in the Wikiloc portal (www.wikiloc.com) (data query in January 2020) for all the municipalities belonging to the Sierra Nevada Natural Protected Area. For each municipality, the total number of routes, and their density (number of routes / surface area of the municipality in ha) were calculated. Each of the oak populations of Sierra Nevada were assigned to the municipalities in which they are present. Of the 47998 routes obtained for the Sierra Nevada mountain range, 49.94\% were in the 14 municipalities where oak woodland are present (Figure \ref{fig:es:socwikiloc}b). The density of routes in these municipalities ranged from 5.24 – 41.8 routes km$^{-2}$  (\tabref{tab:es:wikiloc}) being for most of them much higher than the average density of routes of the Sierra Nevada municipalities (17.88 routes km$^{-2}$).

Data come from automatic counters (pyroelectric sensors) located at different points in the Sierra Nevada.}\label{fig:es:visitorsprofile}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Scientific knowledge}\label{sec:es:cultural-scientific} 
We used two indicators describing research activities to show the relevance of melojo woodlands regarding this ES. Firstly, we explored the spatial pattern of these activities in Sierra Nevada during the period 2009-2013 \autocites{Zamoraetal2017MonitoringGlobal}. For this, we used a database compiling the research authorization documents for the Sierra Nevada Protected Area to generate a density map with the hotspots areas of research activities for this area. Then we extracted the information for the oak populations. Most of the research authorizations are concentrated in the western side of the Sierra Nevada (Figure \ref{fig:es:scientific}b) particularly in the high summits area. The mean values of research permissions for \Qp oak woodlands in the period studied was 3.03 ± 0.06, with Genil and Cáñar oak populations (northwestern and southern oak populations respectively, contains the high concentration of research requests (Figure \ref{fig:es:scientific}b). Secondly, we created a density map of sampling protocols deployed in the Sierra Nevada \autocites{Zamoraetal2017MonitoringGlobal} using data from Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory \autocites{Zamoraetal2016GlobalChange}. All the social-ecological monitoring protocols within this initiative were geolocated to generate a concentration map of sampling protocols by applying geostatistical hotspot detection techniques (Kernel density estimation)\autocites{Zamoraetal2016GlobalChange} (Figure \ref{fig:es:scientific}a). The results showed that the melojo oak woodlands are located in areas of high density of scientific activity (both sampling protocol density and research requested areas) in comparison with the other forest ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/es/es-scientific.pdf}
    \caption{Spatial localization of the research authorizations (Number of research authorizations) performed in Sierra Nevada in the period 2009-2015 (\textbf{a}); and map of density (scaled density) of socioecological monitoring protocols carried out in Sierra Nevada since 2008 (\textbf{b}). For both maps the spatial bounding boxes of each oak population are shown. Drawn from \autocites{Zamoraetal2017MonitoringGlobal,Zamoraetal2016GlobalChange}}\label{fig:es:scientific}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Aesthetic values}\label{sec:es:cultural-aesthetic} 
To explore the aesthetical values of these forests, we used data from \citet{MorenoLlorcaetal2020EvaluatingTourist}) who assessed a series of cultural services in Sierra Nevada by using data from the Flickr platform (www.flickr.com). These authors analysed a total number of 778 photographs and 18 they geolocated in \Qp woodlands (Figure \ref{fig:es:socwikiloc}c). Although this value is low with respect to the total number, it may be due to the fact that the highest density of photos in the analyzed dataset is located around the ski resort, at high altitude areas, and at village areas (mainly the Alpujarras) \autocites{RosCandeiraetal2020SocialMedia}. If we analyse forest separately (\emph{i.e.} native pine, holm oak, melojo oak forests, and pine plantations), the photos taken in melojo oak woodlands represent 32\% of the total.

\subsubsection{Singular trees}\label{sec:es:cultural-trees} 

Singular, large and/or monumental trees, in addition to perform key ecological functions \autocites[\emph{e.g.} nutrient cycling; support complex assemblages of species,][]{LindenmayerLaurance2017EcologyDistribution}, are creditors of natural value \emph{perse} \autocites{Asciutoetal2016MonumentalTrees}. They are considered part of a social realm, providing numerous socio-cultural benefits to society \autocites{BlicharskaMikusinski2014IncorporatingSocial,MoyaMoya2013MonumentalTrees}. Singular trees provide humans with aesthetic, symbolic, religious and historical values \autocites{BlicharskaMikusinski2014IncorporatingSocial}. They can be considered as singular trees by their age, dasometric (height, diameter at breast height), and socio-cultural (\emph{e.g.} surrounding landscape, local myths, legends and traditions, witnessing historical events) characteristics, so their conservation could contribute to the protection of both ecological and also social values \autocites{BlicharskaMikusinski2014IncorporatingSocial}. There are several individuals of \Qp in the study area, located in Busquístar (Alpujarras, southern slopes of Sierra Nevada), considered singular and/or monumental because of their extraordinary dimensions \autocite{IruritaFernandezetal2003ArbolesArboledas}, reaching tree heights of up to 19.5 meters and base perimeter of 6.7 meters. Likewise, there are some oak woodlands in Sierra Nevada that shelter specimens and/or singular populations of other species. For instance, the "Abedular del Barranco de los Alisos", located in the Dúrcal oak woodland \autocites{MartinezLabargaetal1990AbedularRelictico}. It is a small grove of about 300 individuals of birch (\emph{Betula pendula} subsp. \emph{fontqueri}) with an average height of 12 m. Other examples are the grove of birch trees located at the "Barranco de los Alisos", in the Dúrcal melojo population; or the Aliseda de la Cueva del Santo, where there are more than 100 alders (\emph{Alnus glutinosa}) accompanied by melojo oak and chestnut trees. In Andalusia region, there are also other melojo stands catalogued as singular, such as those located in the Sierra del Aljibe (Alcalá de los Gazules, southern Iberian Peninsula), whose specimens do not stand out for their dimensions but their location is unique and of great interest, representing a southern limit of distribution of the species \autocite{SanchezGarciaetal2003ArbolesArboledas}. 


\subsection{Spatial pattern for Ecosystem Services and ecosystem functioning of melojo forest of Sierra Nevada}\label{sec:es:spatial} 

\Qp populations in Sierra Nevada represent a rear-edge of the distribution of this oak species. Peripheral populations are usually considered more vulnerable compared with populations at the center of a species' range \autocite[\emph{i.e}. center-periphery hypothesis][]{Pirononetal2017GeographicVariation}. However, the expected lower performance and higher vulnerability for the peripherical populations do not always meet \autocite[\emph{e.g.}][]{Abelietal2014EffectsMarginality,Oldfatheretal2020RangeEdges,PerezLuqueetal2020LanduseLegacies}. For instance, several studies analyzed the evolution of productivity of melojo oak forests using vegetation indices derived from remote sensing (\emph{e.g.} Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI), and found that Sierra Nevada melojo forests, despite their high seasonality, are the most productive ecosystems in Sierra Nevada \autocites{Dionisioetal2012SatelliteBasedMonitoring,AlcarazSeguraetal2016ChangesVegetation,PerezLuqueetal2015OntologicalSystem,Cazorlaetal2020RemoteSensingbased}. These forests also showed a positive trend in productivity since 2000, highlighting their importance in carbon gain and therefore as carbon sinks \autocite{PerezLuqueetal2015OntologicalSystem} despite their expected low performance. 

The quantification of some ES provided by melojo oak populations in Sierra Nevada, allows us to compare the supply of ES among those populations, and to describe what ES category predominate for each of the oak population cluster’s in this mountain range (\tabref{tab:es:oak-cluster}). This also allows us to explore the spatial pattern of ES supply by the melojo oak forest. Regarding the regulating services evaluated, we observed that the southern populations have higher values for carbon sequestration potential, mean EVI and soil organic carbon than for the other clusters (\figref{fig:es:oak-compare}), despite the theoretically greater vulnerability due to their location in the southernmost areas of Sierra Nevada. For cultural services, the NW populations present high values for sports activities, number of visitors, and density of sampling protocols (scientific value). Finally, for provisioning and support services we observed a variable pattern depending on the service evaluated.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/es/es-plotSN.pdf}\caption{Comparison of ecosystem services (cultural: yellow; regulation: blue; supporting: gray) for oak populations cluster identified in Sierra Nevada. See \tabref{tab:es:oak-cluster} for a detailed description 
}\label{fig:es:oak-compare}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Temporal evolution of Ecosystem Services provision within \Qp forests in Sierra Nevada}\label{sec:es:temporal} 
Analyzing the temporal change of ES is key to understand how human societies have been using natural resources in different time periods. Besides, this approach helps us to understand the temporal trade-offs among ES. We compiled datasets of several ES indicators for which long temporal series were available (\tabref{tab:es:temporal}). Those data were available mainly for one of the oak woodlands (Robledal de Cáñar) located on the southern slope of Sierra Nevada (CAÑ, Figure \ref{fig:es:location}b). 

Both overuse and abandonment of melojo woodlands provide very different scenarios for the provision of ES and for the socioeconomic demand for them. From ancient (not determined) times until the period 1960-1970 there was an intense use of the resources provided by the oak forests. Local inhabitants used firewood from the forests for charcoal and fuel, reflected by the lower oak-tree density of the forests. Oak acorns were harvested for livestock feed (mainly pigs), as reflected in the auction records of the public forests. Therefore, many forest patches were cleared to create pastures for livestock and mountain crops, which explains the lower amount of forest area. In this period, provisioning ES prevailed over the regulating (poorly considered) or the cultural (not considered). Afterwards, due to changes in socio-economic conditions, a process of depopulation of rural areas (rural exodus) began, resulting in the abandonment of traditional activities as were reflected by several indicators (\figref{fig:es:temporal}). For instance, a decrease in the number of sheep (at least since 1956) and beekeeping (at least since 1980). This pattern also shows that provision ES of \Qp forests tend to be less important in Sierra Nevada. It is consistent with other land uses not shown in the graph due to the lack of quantitative data (\emph{e.g.}, wood extraction, extent of agriculture within the forest, etc.). This behavior means, in terms of ES, that there is a trend towards less intense use of some provisioning services in melojo forests in Sierra Nevada. This decrease in the indicators related to provisioning ES coincides with an increase of the area occupied by melojo forests, and a gradual increase in their tree density (both at least since the end of 1950s). This pattern is also reflected in the forest’s primary production (at least since 2000) as EVI temporal series shown (\figref{fig:es:temporal}). Consequently, increased forest productivity is also reflected in a raise in aboveground forest biomass. The consequences in terms of ES, is a reduction of the provisioning services as opposed to an increase in regulating services, mainly due to a recovery of the forest following the almost complete abandonment of traditional activities. On the other hand, after the declaration of Sierra Nevada as natural protected area (1989), there was an increase in the supply of cultural ES, as reflected for example in the increase in the number of visitors (\figref{fig:es:temporal}). The underlying pattern that seems to explain the above-describe trends is also shown in \figref{fig:es:temporal}: the steady and consistent decrease in human population since at least 1960. Our study area has suffered a strong drainage in human population mainly due to the migration to big cities. This demographical pattern could explain the observed decrease in the use of provisioning services, as well as the increase in their production (due to the land abandonment). Besides, the increase in the interest of melojo forests by visitors is also compatible with this demographic situation: the currently more urban people enjoy visiting natural areas during their spare time. 

\begin{sidewaysfigure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{img/es/es-temporal_evolution_modified_v1.pdf}
    \caption{Temporal evolution of indicators of ES supply by \Qp woodlands in Sierra Nevada. See \tabref{tab:es:temporal} for description of the sources. All data referred to Robledal de Cáñar oak woodland (southern slope of Sierra Nevada), except visitors numbers corresponding to all Sierra Nevada Protected Area.}\label{fig:es:temporal}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

Using the sequence of trends described above, we can infer a temporal evolution of the ES provided by melojo forests in Sierra Nevada (\figref{fig:es:schema}). During the first half of XX\textsuperscript{th} century, human activity was intense in our study area. This means that the most relevant ES were those related with the provision of goods (\emph{e.g.}, timber, grassland, crops, etc.). This situation implied an intense use of land that sometimes could threatened some regulating ES (\emph{e.g.}, soil protection, habitat for endangered species, etc.). During the 1950-60s, the situation changed: due to changes in the macroeconomical situation, an intense migration process began to shift population from rural areas to big cities. This involved the abandonment of previous land use and therefore the underutilization of provisioning ES. The creation of two overlapping protected areas (Natural Park in 1989 and National Park in 1999) reinforced this trend by discouraging intense human activities in the area. The reduction in the intensity of use and therefore the decline of  provisioning ES could have fostered a process of secondary succession in the melojo forests. This implied the recovery of many regulating ES such as soil or habitat protection. In the transition from overexploitation to abandonment of the oak forest, many ecosystem services linked to the functioning of an increasingly biodiverse and complex forest ecosystem are being favored. However, in some cases a tradeoff is attained in relation to ecosystem services such as carbon storage. For example, increased forest encroachment implies higher aboveground carbon storage but also higher risk of severe wildfires and therefore carbon losses. Finally, once Spain became a world class tourism attraction (from 2000 onwards), the most relevant ES in our zone are those cultural related to leisure activities.

\section{Concluding remarks}\label{sec:es:concluding} 

In this work we combined a literature review with expert criterion to identify and to characterize the main ecosystem services provide by \Qp woodlands. The literature review revealed the existence of many works related to wine ageing, highlighting the potential of this species for wine production (\tabref{tab:es-review}). Interestingly, this ES has not been identified in our local scale search. It is also remarkable that no work has been found in our literature review that evaluates cultural services in these forests. However, this pattern changes when the ecosystem services are analyzed in more detail as in our case study. Thus, the combination of expert criteria with data at a more local scale allowed us to highlight the existence of diverse cultural ecosystem services provided by these forests. 

Our compilation of local scale data has allowed us to quantify many of these ES, which on the one hand highlights the relevance of these forest formations, and on the other hand, provides to natural resource managers with more information and tools to help them in the decision-making process. Because melojo forest is a human-shaped ecosystem, management is required to guide their development \autocite{Hobbsetal2006NovelEcosystems}. How we manage this new ecosystem effectively is a point for debate. In this sense, incorporating information on ecosystem services can significantly help managers to make decisions due to its integrative and interdisciplinary nature. Our study also adds some interesting insights for the study of ES provided by forests. For instance, we observed a highly variable temporal pattern of some ES, such as the recreational values. Some melojo woodlands of Sierra Nevada concentrate a large part of the visitors recorded in the Sierra Nevada Natural Area (\figref{fig:es:visitorsprofile}) during a specific time period. This highlights the need to consider the temporal dimension of the ES evaluated, and to pay attention to the pressure that these ecosystems may be suffering temporarily due to the high number of visitors. Therefore, from a natural resource management point of view, it is necessary not only to analyze the ES provided by an ecosystem, but also we would consider the spatio-temporal pattern of the ES supply. In this sense, it would be interesting to carry out detailed studies to provide managers with a comprehensive assessment of the possible impacts of visitors.

Another relevant outcome is the differences identified within melojo forests regarding their capacity to provide ES. We observed that southern populations seem to be able to sequester more carbon than northern ones. Besides, northwestern populations are specifically valuable for the cultural services that they provide. The main conclusion regarding these facts is that we need to specifically assess the capacity of ES provision at a local scale. Only by doing so, we would be able to quantify the provision of ES considering the specific biophysical features of each target area. 

Finally, we have assessed the change in ES provision patterns across time of this forest system with high conservation values. Both ancient overuse and current abandonment of melojo woodlands provided contrasting scenarios for the provision of ES and for the socioeconomic demand for them in Sierra Nevada. Although the history of land use patterns in our target area is well known, we have described that history using the framework of ES. We observed how the land use could modified the temporal provision of the ES in the melojo forests.

All these results provide enough evidence for us to advocate for the promotion of local scale studies like this one. The combination of literature research with analysis of local long term series and with detailed understanding of the target populations, has allowed us to unveil ES patterns that otherwise would have been kept hidden. Besides, thanks to the existence of the ES conceptual framework, our results can be easily compared with other studies done in other areas. Thus, we conclude that local scale studies can be a good way to gather information on ES supply both at a local and at larger scales.
